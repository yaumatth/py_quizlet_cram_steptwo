# DATA 533: Collaborative Software Development

# Project Step 3

## Objective
1.	Understanding how to set-up continuous integration 
2.	Understanding how to write code to handle errors and exceptions 

## Overall goal
In this lab, you will work collaboratively in the group you formed in project step 1. This time, you will set up continuous integration using any CI/CD tools (e.g., Travis-CI). 

You will work on the same modules and methods that you develop in your project step 2, however, will add more codes that handle errors and exceptions gracefully.

You must ensure that the test suite for each function provides at least 75% coverage (if less, please consult with the instructor or the TA). Please include documentation (e.g., screenshots of [coverage.py]( https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/6.5.0/) report) that shows you’ve checked for code coverage.

Continuous integration is set up (e..g, using Travis-CI or any other tool) and the package README contains a status image showing the [status of your build](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/status-images/#travis-ci-pages-show-the-default-branchs-result).

## Specific Expectations (20 marks)
- [4 marks] You must need to configure continuous integration testing using Travis-CI or any other tool.
    - You can create a new GitHub repository and store your project step 2 code there. Add the other group member as a collaborator to the repository.
    - Clone the repository to your local machine. Create a new branch and write new code there.
    - Ask your group member to clone the GitHub repository and write code in a new branch.
    - Frequently push your updated code (i.e., the local repositories - at least once a day) to the GitHub repository.
    - You must need to configure continuous integration testing to handle the builds automatically
    - Create pull requests and merge your code into the master branch.
- [6 marks] At least six methods contain appropriate error and exception handlers (out of six exceptions, one exception should be user-defined exceptions).
- [3 marks] You must ensure that the test suite for each function provides at least 75% coverage.
    - Provide screenshots showing the coverage reports
- [1 mark] Your package README should contain a passing build stamp (see Resources).
- [2 marks] Upload a video describing the functionalities of the package, sub-package and modules showing how they work (5 min max - similar to the video that I shared with you before).
- [2 marks] Have a Git history demonstrating that the group members contributed equally.
- [2 marks] Publish the package (i.e., upload the package to PyPi) and add the link to the README file.

## Submission instructions: 

Please submit your GitHub or GitHub classroom link to Canvas (one submission from a group is good enough)

# DATA 533: Collaborative Software Development

# Project Step 2

## Objective
1.	Understanding how to use `unittest` framework to write testing code in Python
2.	Understanding how to use collaborative features of a version control tool


## Overall goal
In this project step, you will work collaboratively in the same group that you formed in project step 1. This time, you will write code for unit tests in Python using the `unittest` framework. 

You will work on the same modules and functions that you develop in your project step 1, however, will add more codes that handle errors gracefully.

## Specific Expectations (20 marks)
Now it's time to start testing the package that you developed in project step 1. Specific expectations for this step are:
#### Unit Testing Requirements (14 marks):
 - [12 marks] Create at least six test classes (in separate files) for the six modules that you developed in project step 1.
    - [8 marks] Each test class should have at least two test cases and each test case should contain at least four assertion statements.
    - [4 marks] Each test class should use the `setup()`, `tearDown()`, `setUpClass(cls)`, and `tearDownClass(cls)` methods to initialize values appropriately.
 - [2 marks] Create a test suite to hold the collection of test classes that you developed in the previous step. Check the test suite to ensure that it calls the test classes properly.

#### GitHub Requirements (6 marks)
 - Create a new GitHub repository and store your project step 1 code there. Add the other group member as a collaborator to the repository. 
 - Clone the repository to your local machine. Create a new branch and write test classes/test suite there. 
 - Ask your group member to clone the GitHub repository, start writing code in a new branch. 
 - When you are done with writing your code (or the other member is done with his/her code), push the local repositories to the GitHub repository. 
 - Create pull requests and merge your code into the master branch.
 - Have a Git history to demonstrates that the group members contributed equally.

## Submission instructions: 

Please submit your GitHub or GitHub classroom link (one submission from a group is good enough)
